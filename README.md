# Investigation on the Relationship Between Amount of Protein and Rating of Recipes
Author:Haoyu Guo
## Overview ##
This is a data science project for DSC80 at UCSD focusing on exploring the relationship between the rating of a recipe and the proportion of protein contributing to the total calories of the given recipe.
## Introduction ##
Protein is an essential nutrient for human health, crucial for the formation of body cells, tissues, and organs, and plays roles in various biochemical processes in the body. In today's health-conscious society, protein plays a central role in increasing muscle mass and strength. During strength training or other forms of resistance training, muscle fibers incur minor damage. To repair these damages and gradually strengthen the muscles, the body requires protein. Against this backdrop, we aim to explore if there is a correlation between the protein content in people's diets and the average rating of recipes. We want to determine if people rate recipes higher in protein content to accelerate muscle gain. 
For this purpose, we analyzed two datasets, including recipes and ratings posted on food.com since 2008. These datasets were originally used for the research paper on recommendation systems by Majumder et al., titled "Generating Personalized Recipes from Historical User Preferences."
